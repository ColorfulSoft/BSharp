## Detailed comparison

### Runtime

B# and C# compilers are cross-platform .NET applications, while Python is written in C/C++ and is not purely cross-platform at least in binary level. You can't run Python program in Linux Mint using runtime for MS Windows and vise versa. B# compiler is compatible with .NET Framework and Mono on all supported platforms in binary level (yes, you may run same bsc.exe in Windows, Linux and macOS). The same applies to applications written in B#, if they do not initially use platform-dependent features, for example, WinAPI.
