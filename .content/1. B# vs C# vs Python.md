## Detailed comparison

### Runtime

B# and C# compilers are cross-platform .NET applications, while Python is written in C/C++ and is not purely cross-platform at least in binary level. You can't run Python program in Linux Mint using runtime for MS Windows and vise versa. B# and C# compilers are compatible with .NET Framework and Mono on all supported platforms in binary level (yes, you may run same bsc.exe or csc.exe in Windows, Linux and macOS). The same applies to applications written in B# and C#, if they do not initially use platform-dependent features, for example, WinAPI. A Python program requires a Python runtime, a B# program requires .NET or Mono to run, however, the B# program is not delivered in the form of source codes, but in the form of compiled .NET bytecode, natively compatible with others .NET languages.

### Syntax

B# inherits syntax of B, C++ and C# languages, this means, for example, that an error in the space sign will not lead to a disaster. Also you may rapidly learn B# if you already have some expearence in C++ or C#. Meanwhile, C# and B# languages have syntax differences due to dynamic typing in B#. Below are some comparisons of operations.
