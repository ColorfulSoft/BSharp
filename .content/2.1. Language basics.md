# B# Language basics

## Keywords

#### Name import

* `using` - Directive to import name into source file (compilation unit) context.
* `from` - Import source specifier in `using <name> from <name>;` statement.
* `as` - Alias specifier in `using <name> as <name>;` and `using <name> from <name> as <name>;` statement.

#### Member definition

* `namespace` - Namespace declarator in `namespace <name>{<members>}` statement.
* `interface` - Interface declarator in `<attributes> interface <name>{<declarations>}` statement.
* `enum` - Enumerable declarator in `<attributes> enum <name>{<members>}` statement.
* `class` - Class declarator in `<attributes> class <name>{<members>}` statement.

#### Access modifiers

* `public` - Allows full access to a member `public <member>`.
* `internal` - Allows full access in containing assembly to a member `internal <member>`.
* `protected` - Allows access in inherited classes to a member `protected <member>`.
* `private` - Allows access only in containing class to a member `private <member>`.

#### Polymorphism and inheritance attributes

* `static` - Marks class as sealed and forbides instance creating `static class <name>{}` or marks member as associated with type, but not with instance `static <member>`.
* `sealed` - Forbides inheritance from a class `sealed class <name>{}` or forbides virtual member overriding in child classes `sealed <member>`.
* `virtual` - Allows member overriding in child classes `virtual <member>`.
* `override` - Redefines virtual member of parent class `override <member>`.
* `abstract` - Mark class as abstract and forbides instance creating `abstract class <name>{}` or marks member as abstract (pure virtual in C++) and requiring an overriding in child class.

#### Object model

* `var` - Defines a variable `var <name> = <expression>`.
* `unmanaged` - Specifies that an array must be created in unmanaged memory in `unmanaged new <type>[<expression>]` expression.
* `new` - Initializes a new instance in `new <type>(<arguments>)` expression, initializes a typed array in `new <type>[<expression>]` expression or initializes an untyped array (object[]) in `new []{<expression>, <expression>, ...}` statement.
* `delete` - Deletes a managed object in `delete <expression>;` statement or releases unmanaged memory if `<expression>` is a pointer in `delete <expression>;` statement.
* `constructor` - Defines constructor of the class in `<attributes> constructor(<parameters>){}` statement.
* `destructor` - Defines destructor of the class in `destructor(){}` statement.
* `operator` - Defines operator overloading in type in `<modifiers> operator <symbol>(<parameters>){}` statement or specifies operator overloading method in `<expression>.operator <symbol>(<arguments>)` expression.
* `get` - Getter method declarator of the property in `<access modifier> get;` and `<access modifier> get{}` statements.
* `set` - Setter method declarator of the property in `<access modifier> set;` and `<access modifier> set{}` statements.
* `value` - Backing field accessor in the property accessors.
* `this` - Reference to the current object in type definition statement.

#### Control flow

* `if` - Branching operator in `if(<condition>){}` statement.
* `elif` - Else if branch in condition operator in `elif(<condition>){}` statement.
* `else` - Else branch in condition operator in `else{}` statement.
* `for` - Cycle with a counter operator in `for(<initialization>; <condition>; <step operators>){}` statement or range based for in `for(<variable> in <collection>){}` statement.
* `while` - Cycle with a precondition in `while(<condition>){}` statement.
* `do` - Cycle with a postcondition in `do{}while(condition);` statement.
* `goto` - Unconditional transition to the label in `goto <label>` statement.
* `break` - Exit from the nearest cycle in `break;` statement, exit from the all `n` top cycles in `break <n>` statement or exit from `case` branch in `switch` operator in `break;` statement.
* `continue` - Moving to a new iteration of the cycle in `continue;` statement or moving to a new iteration of the `n`-th top cycle in `continue <n>;` statement.
* `return` - Exiting the method without a value in `return;` statement or exiting the method with a value in `return <value>;` statement.

## Operators

#### Unary operators

* `+` - Unary plus in `+<value>` expression.
* `-` - Unary minus in `-<value>` expression.
* `*` - Dereferencing a pointer in `*<value>` expression.
* `&` - Taking an address in `&<value>` expression.
* `++` - Prefix increment in `++<value>` statement or postfix increment in `<value>++` statement.
* `--` - Prefix decrement in `--<value>` statement or postfix decrement in `<value>--` statement.
* `~` - Bitwise not in `~<value>` statement.
* `!` - Logical not in `!<value>` statement.
